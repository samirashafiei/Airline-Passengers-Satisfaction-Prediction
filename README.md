# Airline-Passengers-Satisfaction-Prediction

Measuring customer satisfaction is about profit and competitive advantage. In this project, I used Deep Learning techniques to predict airline passengers' satisfaction and identify the most important factors that influence customers satisfaction. The goal is to build a model that could be used by an airline company to successfully choose the most important ways to improve customer satisfaction. 

# Objectives:
Build models using Python to predict passengers satisfaction
- Logistic Regression Model
- Deep Learning Model

I used the logistic regression model as a baseline to compare neural network performance to. 

# Data
The data I am using for this project is from Kaggle called “train”.  There are 25 attributes including Id, Gender, Customer Type, Age, Type of Travel, Class, Flight Distance, Inflight wifi service,Seat comfort, Departure/Arrival time convenient, Ease of Online booking, Gate location, Food and drink, Online boarding, Inflight entertainment, On-board service, Leg room service, Checkin service, Cleanliness, Baggage handling, Departure Delay in Minutes, Arrival Delay in Minute. The dataset has 103904 records.
